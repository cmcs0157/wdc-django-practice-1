# Django practice nÂº 1


### Setup Instruction

```bash
$ mkvirtualenv -p $(which python3) django_practice_1
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can now run the development server:

```bash
$ make runserver
```


### Your Tasks

The structure of the whole Django project is built for you. Your job is to implement the views that are under `django_practice_1/views.py`, and complete the proper URLs in `django_practice_1/urls.py`.

Running the development server with `$ make runserver`, you'll be able to test your views in the browser pointing to `http://localhost:8080/<some-path>`


#### 1. hello_world view:

Implement a simple view under `/hello-world` URL that returns a 'Hello World' string. Use the function `HttpResponse()` imported from Django.

#### 5. profile view:

Implement a view under `/profile` URL that renders the `profile.html` sending the given dictionary as context. You'll need to use the `render()` function imported from Django. Also make sure to complete the template with the context data in the proper places.

#### 6. authors and author views:

The goal for this task is to practice routing between two URLs.
You will have:
* `/authors` --> contains a list of Authors (template is provided to you)
* `/author/<authors_last_name>` --> contains the detail for given author, using the AUTHORS_INFO provided to you.

First view just have to render the given `authors.html` template sending the AUTHORS_INFO as context.

Second view has to take the `authors_last_name` provided in the URL, look for for the proper author info in the dictionary, and send it as context while rendering the `author.html` template. Make sure to complete the given `author.html` template with the data that you send.
